Iâ€™m a **fourth-year DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, where I am co-supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com) and [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I'm also a member of the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).

I recently completed a **research internship at Wayve**, working in the [World Models Team](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/) on video generation for autonomous vehicles. Previously, I completed SWE internships at **Amazon**, **Arm**, and **Cubica**.
