<!-- I’m a **graduating DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, where I am co-supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com) and [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/).

I recently finished as a **student researcher at Google DeepMind** in London, where I worked on applications of [Genie 3](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/) to [SIMA 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04797) and Robotics. Previously, I completed a research internship at **Wayve**, working in the World Models Team on [video generation for autonomous vehicles](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/), as well as SWE internships at **Amazon**, **Arm**, and **Cubica**. -->
