Iâ€™m a **third year DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, where I am co-supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com) and [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I'm also a member of the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).

I'm currently completing a **research internship at Wayve**, working in the [World Models Team](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/). Previously, I completed SWE internships at **Amazon**, **Arm** and **Cubica** (acquired).

I recently appeared alongside [Chris Lu](https://chrislu.page/) on the [AutoML Podcast](https://x.com/The_Eimer/status/1805288632749568176) to discuss our work on meta-RL!
