Iâ€™m a **fourth-year DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, where I am co-supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com) and [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/).

I'm currently a **student researcher at Google DeepMind** in London, working on [Genie](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/). Previously, I completed a research internship at **Wayve**, working in the World Models Team on [video generation for autonomous vehicles](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/), as well as SWE internships at **Amazon**, **Arm**, and **Cubica**.
