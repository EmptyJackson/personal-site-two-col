I’m a **third year DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, where I am co-supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://foersterlab.com) and [Shimon Whiteson](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). I'm also a member of the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/).

I’ve completed software engineering **internships at Amazon, Arm and Cubica Technology**, working on natural language processing, computer vision and efficient network inference.
I previously completed an MSc in Machine Learning from University College London and a BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.
