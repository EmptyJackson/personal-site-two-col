<!-- I'm interested in building extremely general agents. -->

Currently, I'm exploring how VLMs can improve RL (**synthetic data, representation learning**), and how RL can improve VLMs (**reasoning, tool-use**).

I have published work on **offline, meta, and open-ended RL**, as well as **diffusion models** and **plasticity**.
