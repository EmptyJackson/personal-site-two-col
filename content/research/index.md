<!-- I'm interested in building extremely general agents. -->

<!-- Currently, I'm exploring how VLMs can improve RL (**synthetic data, representation learning**), and how RL can improve VLMs (**reasoning, tool-use**). -->

<!-- I'm focused on **video world models** and **reinforcement learning** for **generalist embodied agents**.

I have published work on **offline, meta, and open-ended RL**, as well as **video diffusion models** and **plasticity**. -->
